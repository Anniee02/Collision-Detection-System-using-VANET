# Collision-Detection-System-using-VANET
The Internet of Things (IoT) is the interconnection of uniquely identifiable embedded
computing devices within the existing Internet infrastructure. Typically, IoT offers advanced
connectivity of devices, systems, and services that goes beyond machine-to-machine
communications (M2M) and covers a variety of protocols, domains, and applications. The
interconnection of these embedded devices (including smart objects), is implemented in nearly all
fields of automation enabling advanced applications like a Smart Grid.
In this project, we are working on a “Collision Detection System”. An enormous
population, with the increasing number of vehicles leads to heavy traffic and thousands of people
die in road accidents across the world, creating a global hazard.
Deaths and disabilities by road accidents are increasing with each passing year. An increase
in population and per capita incomes has led to an increase in ownership and the presence of
vehicles on roads. Greater traffic volumes, over speeding, reckless and drunken driving, driver
fatigue, poor road infrastructure and the presence of animals on roads are some reasons that are
responsible for road fatalities.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the percentage of road accident
fatalities to the total number of deaths worldwide has increased by 2.2% . Approximately 1.35
million people die due to road accidents every year. In many cases, human lives are lost in road
accidents due to delays in emergency medical assistance. According to Golden Hour Principle,
there is a high probability that timely medical and surgical aid can avoid death during the golden
hour, which is the period after the traumatic injury. A decrease in the response time of emergency
medical care can reduce the probability of death by one-third on an average . The percentage of
people who die before reaching the hospital is high. In the recent past, information and
communication technology such as IoT has been used to decrease the accident rescue time.
The victims of numerous accidents that frequently go unreported and result in fatalities need
to be handled . The gadget need to be capable of speaking with the neighborhood hospital and
police station right away in the event of an accident. We require a method to aid in identifying these
mishaps and pinpointing their locations so that the rescue crew and the rider's emergency contacts
can be informed.
So, we recommend this technique, which is crucial for the thorough detection and individual
control of regrettable accidents. Every day, millions of people are killed or injured in traffic
accidents. The vast majority of incidents are not catastrophic, but neither is the tragically high death
toll brought on by irrational delays in local emergency services. Since we don't know where a
potential accident will naturally occur, we are ill-equipped to determine an accident site. They
normally offer adequate medical care to the injured person, but they urgently require assistance to
determine the precise site of the accident. They can only do this by tracking their whereabouts and
communicating with a family member or the local emergency services.
